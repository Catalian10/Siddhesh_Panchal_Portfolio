As Internet is a very important factor in todays world with having connection that supports Organizations, Goverments, Individuals to carry out their tasks respectively. Having a good internet speed becomes more crutial in this aspect.

In this file we are analyzing the dataset using 'Tidyverse' package in R. The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. See how the tidyverse makes data science faster, easier and more fun with “R for Data Science”.
